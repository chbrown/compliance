* The Texas Legislature has mandated that all new state employees receive training on sexual harassment during the initial 30 days of employment, and supplemental training every two years.
* The core material used in this training was provided to the University by the Texas Workforce Commission, Civil Rights Division. Supplemental material is included in the training so that you will know the University's policies in this area.
* Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination based on sex.  In this training module, we will be discussing sexual harassment in the employment context.
* However, it is important to remember that students are also protected against sexual harassment in their status as students.

* Sexual harassment of employees is a violation of University and Board of Regents Policies, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.
* The University of Texas at Austin is committed to an academic and employment environment free from unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other forms of sexual harassment.  The University's policy may be found in the Handbook of Operating Procedures 3-3030, Sex Discrimination and Sexual Harassment.
* The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued guidelines defining sexual harassment.  Sexual Harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:
  1. Submission to or tolerance of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; or
  2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
  3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
* The University will promptly investigate complaints of sexual harassment and will take disciplinary action against individuals who are found to have engaged in sexual harassment.

* Sexual harassment generally follows one of two forms: Quid pro Quo or Hostile Environment harassment.
* Quid pro quo harassment occurs when submission to or rejection of unwelcome physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting another individual.  Put another way, this is the traditional "go out with me and you get the job or promotion" type of harassment.
* There obviously must be a power differential between the parties in that the harasser must have the power to give or deny an opportunity to the other party.

* The other form of sexual harassment is hostile or environmental harassment.  This form is more prevalent and occurs when unwelcome sexual conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's job performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or educational environment.
* In this form of sexual harassment, the elements of pervasiveness, persistence, severity, or unwelcomeness are present.  These elements ultimately create a hostile environment which interferes with one's work environment or educational opportunities.
* In deciding whether the conduct creates a hostile environment, the totality of the circumstances in which it occurred is considered, including the context of the conduct, its frequency, its severity, and whether it was physically threatening and humiliating or an offensive utterance.
* In most cases, a persistent and pervasive pattern of such conduct will need to be present in order for the conduct to be considered a violation of institutional policy.  The U.S. Supreme Court held that sexual harassment that is so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment violates Title VII.

* Let's take a look at the following question regarding institutional liability.
* If the victim of the sexual harassment does not complain or report the harassment, can the University be held responsible for the unwelcome conduct when committed by a * supervisor or manager?  The answer to this question is yes.
* If the victim suffers a tangible economic loss, the employer may be held responsible because the harasser was a supervisor or manager.

* Remember, both men and women may be victims or harassers, or both.
* A man as well as a woman can be the victim of Sexual Harassment or Sexual Misconduct.  And a man or a woman can be the harasser.
* The victim does not have to be someone of the opposite sex of the harasser.

* Also remember that sexual harassment can occur between supervisor and employee, coworker and coworker, professor and student, and student and student.
* The alleged harasser may also be someone who comes to campus and exhibits inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature towards our students or staff.
* And note that the victim of sexual harassment does not have to be the individual to whom the unwelcome sexual conduct is directed.  The victim may be someone who is affected by the conduct in that it interferes with the victim's ability to perform the job, or creates a hostile and intimidating work environment.

* Sexual Misconduct is a phrase introduced by the University of Texas System Board of Regents, and has been incorporated into the University's Policy on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment.
* Sexual Misconduct is behavior of a sexual nature that is unprofessional and/or inappropriate for the workplace or classroom but that does not rise to the level of sexual harassment.
* Behaviors that may constitute sexual misconduct include but are not limited to:
  - Failure to observe the appropriate professional boundaries of the supervisor/subordinate or faculty/student relationship.
  - Relationships between a supervisor or a faculty member and his or her subordinate employee or student that places other employees or students at a professional or educational disadvantage.
  - Repeatedly engaging in sexually oriented conversations, comments or horseplay, including the use of language or the telling of jokes or anecdotes of a sexual nature in the workplace, office or classroom, even if such conduct is not objected to by those present.
  - Gratuitous use of sexually oriented materials not directly related to the subject matter of a class, course or meeting even if not objected to by those present.

* What can you do if you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment or sexual misconduct?
* At the University, the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE) has been authorized by the President to receive complaints or concerns on sexual harassment or sexual misconduct.  The office of OIE provides consultative and investigative services regarding allegations of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct.
* It is the hope of the University that you will raise your concerns to this office, which will provide resolution within required timelines.
* Please feel free to visit the OIE website for relevant university policies, which can be downloaded.  Or, call the office at 512-471-1849 for information, consultation, or appointment.
* Confidentiality will be maintained, within confines of the law.

* To raise a concern outside or external to the University, an individual may contact the Texas Workforce Commission, Civil Rights Division, an agency of the State of Texas that enforces the state law prohibiting employment discrimination; or, an individual may contact the EEOC, a federal agency, which enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.
* There are time requirements for filing a complaint of discrimination with these agencies.  There is no requirement that you exhaust internal administrative review options prior to filing a complaint with these agencies.  It is, however, the University's hope that you utilize our internal services.
* Filing a complaint internally does not negate your right to file an external complaint.

* The Consensual Relationships Policy found in the Handbook of Operating Procedures 3-3050 defines consensual relationships as a mutually acceptable, romantic and/or sexual relationship between a University employee with supervisory, teaching, evaluation or advisory authority and an employee, student, and/or student employee who is directly supervised, taught, evaluated or advised by that employee.
* It is the policy of The University that employees with direct teaching, supervisory, advisory, or evaluative responsibility over other employees, students and/or student employees recognize and respect the ethical and professional boundaries that must exist in such relationships.


## Page 12 of 13

* Consensual relationships, as defined by this policy, create conflicts of interest and/or appearances of impropriety that impair the integrity of academic and employment decisions. Such relationships also contain the potential for exploitation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee and the possible professional or academic disadvantage of third parties, and can subject both the University and the individuals to the risk of liability.
* Therefore, the University strongly discourages consensual relationships covered under this policy. Should such a relationship develop, there is an obligation on the part of the supervisor, teacher or advisor to disclose its existence to an immediate supervisor and to cooperate in making alternative arrangements for the subordinate.
* Employees in a position of authority who enter into or persist in consensual romantic or sexual relationships without reporting them, or fail to cooperate in efforts to eliminate the conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety they present, will be subject to disciplinary action.
* In the event that a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct is brought by the subordinate party regarding the unreported relationship, there will be no presumption that the relationship was consensual in nature.
