Sexual Harassment is a form of sex discrimination that involves the imposition of an unwanted condition or requirement on the continued employment or education of the victim. Two forms of sexual harassment are:

    Quid pro quo harassment
    Hostile environment harassment

Sexual Misconduct is conduct of a sexual nature that, although not so serious or pervasive that it rises to the level of sexual harassment, is unprofessional and/or inappropriate for the educational and working environment.
Sexual Assault is an umbrella legal term that describes a variety of sexual violations, including (but not limited to) rape, attempted rape, and sexual abuse. These violations can happen between any two individuals, regardless of their gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, ability, and/or religious identity. The roots of sexual assault lie in one person's need and/or desire for power over another person. Sexual assault is never about love or attraction. It is about control and domination.
Sex Discrimination is conduct, which can include sexual harassment that is directed at a specific individual or group of identifiable individuals that subjects the individual or group to treatment that adversely affects the individual or group’s employment or education on account of sex.
Consensual Relationships involve two willing participants in a relationship free from (real or perceived) power differentials or coercion.
Consent is assent in fact, whether express or apparent, by all of the involved parties to engage in the same sexual activity at the same time.

If someone trusts you enough to confide in you that they are a survivor of sexual assault, follow these basic principles to help support the survivor's well-being and create an environment beneficial to their continued healing and support-seeking.

    Believing – Sex discrimination and Sexual Harassment/Misconduct/Assault are horrible experiences that no one wants to endure. Survivors need your support and belief in them, not your doubt.
    Listening - Allow the person to say what they need to say and share what they feel safe in sharing; do not interrupt or make assumptions about what they have or will say.
    Offering options - Offer options for seeking help and support. Ask them what they need. They are the ones who have been living this difficult experience and know what they need or what would be helpful.
    Get Help for Yourself – Do not feel like you have to hold on to all of this information, it can be overwhelming and scary. It is important to tell a campus reporting authority, like your advisor or someone in the Office of the Dean of Students.
