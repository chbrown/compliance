## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Do I have to train my entire membership?

    Yes. If they are considered a member (including any adjective in front of it such as pledge, new, active, etc.) by your governing documents, internal practices, or convention, then you are required to train them. Your full membership also includes any member who will be graduating at the end of the current semester or enrolled in a formal UT academic program at a location away from the main campus unless an exemption is received in writing from Student Activities. Please be aware that only current students, faculty, or staff are eligible to be members of a registered student organization.

2. Can I just email the required PowerPoint to the membership and have it count as our presentation?

    No. You are not permitted to email or otherwise electronically transmit the PowerPoint presentation to your membership and have it count as your presentation to the full membership. The law requires all of the authorized representatives who complete the student leader training (online modules and in-person workshop) to present the information using the required Student Leader Training Kit at a scheduled meeting (or meetings) of the full membership.

3. Can I email the required Handouts in advance of the meeting(s) in which we train the membership?

    Yes. While we prefer that everyone have a copy when the presentation (or presentations) is made, we realize that it could become costly to print out all the handouts. It is permitted to email the handouts ONLY to your full membership in advance of the presentation (or presentations) as long as a statement is included in your email explaining that it is required for each member to read and understand the materials.

4. Are there any alternative ways to comply with the requirement of "presenting the information to our full membership"?

    Yes. If you hold at least one membership meeting for the purposes of training but still have members who missed it, you can use one of the following alternatives that are approved by the Office of the Dean of Students to meet the "presentation to the full membership" standard required under state law:

    * Multiple Meetings: The trained authorized representatives can hold additional meetings to conduct makeup training for those who missed the previous meeting.
    * Individual Meetings: A trained authorized representative can meet with a member individually using a laptop and present the PPT to the member and discuss the handouts.
    * Video Presentation: The trained authorized representatives of your registered student organization can record the presentation given at a meeting of the membership using a video camera (make sure the PPT and presenters are clearly visible and audio heard) and let members who missed the meeting view it.

5. Does our registered student organization have to approve a safety policy every year?

    Yes. All registered student organizations required to participate in the Safety Education Program must annually adopt a safety policy that, at a minimum, outlines policies and practices for the eight (8) risk management topics covered in the Safety Education Program. Each registered student organizations can either:

    * adopt the safety policy developed by the Office of the Dean of Students; OR
    * adopt a safety policy required by a national organization that is formally associated with your registered student organization (as long as the policy addresses all eight topics covered in the Safety Education Program).

    In addition, the authorized representatives of the registered student organization must also annually distribute a copy of the policy to each member or prospective member of the registered student organization.
