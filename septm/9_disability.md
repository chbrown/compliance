“You can become disabled from your mother’s poor nutrition or from falling off your polo pony.
And, since disability catches up with most of us in old age, it is a minority that we all, if we live long enough, join.”
(Joseph Shapiro, No Pity)

    Anyone can become a person with a disability at any time through injury or illness, making it a diverse minority group
    Approximately 1:5 Americans self-report having a disability (US Census)

    Disability should be seen as a difference in the way people experience or react to life around them, not viewed as a tragedy or with pity
        Some people roll instead of walk or communicate with sign language instead of speaking
        People live with disabilities, they do not suffer from disabilities
    People often experience discrimination, oppression, and limited opportunities because of their disability and perceived limitations
        Federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, protect the rights of people with disabilities and require places to be accessible
    People with disabilities deserve the same respect and dignity that is given to people of any other minority group

    Each person’s experience with their disability will be unique. Even two people with the same diagnosis will often have a different experience with their disability
        Some people who are legally blind have some usable vision while others may have no vision
    Some people have had their disability since birth and others will have acquired a disability later in life. People familiar with their disability may know what does and does not work for them, while people new to a disability may still be figuring out how to live with their disability.
    Some disabilities affect people differently at different times; just because a person appears to be functioning well does not mean their disability is not real
        Epilepsy (seizures) or migraines can occur sporadically and unexpectedly
        Some conditions go through “flare ups” that require rest or hospitalization
        Medication changes can result in an increase in symptoms during the adjustment period

    An invisible disability cannot be detected by looking at a person
        The majority of disabilities are invisible, including most Medical Disabilities, ADHD, Learning Disabilities, Psychological Disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder,  TBI, and in some cases Intellectual, Visual, Mobility, and Hearing Disabilities
        People may not feel comfortable disclosing their invisible disability for fear of judgment or concerns about being treated differently
    A visible disability is often noticed because of use of an assistive device (wheelchair, crutches, prosthetic, hearing aid, guide dog, etc)

    Use Person First Language
        Address the person before the disability
            Professor with a disability (instead of disabled professor)
            Student who uses a wheelchair (instead of confined to a wheelchair or wheelchair bound)
    Avoid language with negative meaning
        Retarded, Psycho, What’s wrong with you, suffering, etc.

    Assume Competence: disability does not always mean inability
        People with disabilities may need to take longer or approach a task differently but typically can still accomplish or goals or tasks they attempt
        If you have questions, ask how, not if
            How do you use a computer vs Can you use a computer
            How will be the best way for you to accomplish this vs Are you going to be able to do this
        Work together to find a creative solution if challenges arise
    Ask if help is needed before assisting and respect the person’s answer
    Focus on similarities rather than differences
        Focus on common areas of interest (music, movies, sports, hobbies) rather than difference caused by disability

    Universities are required to be accessible for people with disabilities. By incorporating accessibility into the planning process, departments and organizations can ensure that everyone can participate fully in events, activities, and programs
    Consider possible barriers to participation and work to reduce or remove them
    Always include an accommodation request in advertising so that people with disabilities feel included and are able to receive the accommodations they need (suggested wording below, can be included with RSVP)
        If you need accommodations for this event [or to RSVP], please contact `___________`. (Note: use “accommodations” in place of “special accommodations”

Physical Barriers

    Is the building accessible? (Access to ramps/ elevators to enter and exit building, location of parking)

    Will any visual material be able to be verbally described? (Graphs, charts, images)
    Will communication be accessible to everyone? (Use of amplification systems, American Sign Language(ASL) interpreters if requested)

Attitudinal Barriers

    Is an accommodation request included in advertisement?
    Are event organizers willing to make adjustments on short notice? (Allowing interpreters to adjust seating, asking if assistance is needed)
    Are people with disabilities given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the event?
