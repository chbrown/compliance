The roles of tutoring and mentoring are distinct, and as a mentor or tutor it is important to understand what is expected of you. As a tutor, you will be expected to help the minor develop the skills they are learning in class to the point where they can independently demonstrate an adequate level of proficiency. As a mentor, you will be expected to act as a role model for the minor, and to encourage and support them as they develop their skills and interests.

    Tutoring:
        Tutoring involves giving individual instruction to a student, generally in a structured manner
        A tutor should help the student become independently capable of meeting the expectations of their class or classes
    Mentoring:
        Mentoring involves acting as a role model and source of support and encouragement
        A mentor should act as a resource for the person being mentored, sharing knowledge and experience

You will have a lot of influence upon the minor you mentor or tutor, and your actions, demeanor, and words will all be studied. If you seem interested in the success of the minor, and demonstrate patience and perseverance, there is a good chance that over time they will emulate those characteristics. The minor, however, is also likely to mirror any frustration, impatience, or disinterest you demonstrate, so it is very important to be aware of not only your actions, but also your tone and the way you carry yourself.

Remember

    The minor will be listening to you
    You are a role model

For both mentoring and tutoring, following appropriate risk management principles is absolutely essential. These rules are for the benefit of both yourself and your student/mentee. They also are important in protecting you from legal liability. Remember that you are in a professional role, and you have legal responsibilities to uphold. Failing to do so could result in serious legal and financial consequences or unintended harm.

The following slides will give a brief overview of basic risk management rules and principles. Please keep in mind that the information given in these slides should not be viewed as the total representation of relevant risk management rules and principles. Always use common sense, and anytime you have doubts about a situation check with your program coordinator and/or university officials.

The rules will help you to ensure:

    Appropriate interaction between program staff/volunteers and minors and
    Provide for a safe environment

One-on-One interactions between program staff/volunteers and minors should be limited (i.e. at least two adults should be present at all times with youth). No adult should ever be alone with a camper in an isolated place. In situations that require personal conferences, the meeting is to be conducted in view of other program staff/volunteers.

No minor or teenager should ever sit on the lap of a program staff or volunteers. No adult is to allow a minor or teenager to sit on his/her lap or lie in his/her bed. The only exception would be the parent/caregiver of the minor.

No frontal hugs. An adult from time to time may feel a minor's need for a hug in order to support or comfort the minor. The adult must use a shoulder-to-shoulder hug.

Contact between program staff/volunteers and youth is restricted to organization-sanctioned activities and times. Program staff/volunteers should not contact youth outside of program activities or program specific needs. Counselors should never serve as babysitters for camp participants during a camp session.

Rough housing or hazing is prohibited. Program staff/volunteers will not wrestle, tickle, or in any way engage a minor or teenager in an activity where the adult’s hands might come in contact with the breasts or genital area of the camper. Staff and volunteers must be particularly careful about physical contact with campers while in the swimming area. No counselor or camper is to participate in any kind of hazing or initiation activity.

Wear appropriate attire. Adults will at all times be dressed modestly. Clothes such as swimsuits, shorts, and tops are not to be revealing or in any way draw attention to the breasts, buttocks, or genital area. Equally important, program staff/volunteers should monitor the clothing worn by minors. Youth clothing should follow the same guidelines above and should be appropriate for the weather and program activities.

Respect privacy:  Adults must respect the privacy of camps in situations such as changing clothes and taking showers. Only in emergency situations should an adult enter an area where minors are unclothed. An adult would only intrude to the extent that the health and or safety of the camper would be in question. In the case of safety, one adult may enter the private area, but whenever possible two adults should be present. Campers must also respect the privacy of the adults in these situations. Therefore, it is not permissible for campers or adults to move about in the housing area unclothed.

Counselor(s) sleeping accommodations: Adults should sleep in an area where they can exercise the highest level of minor supervision, but not isolate themselves from general view. When wilderness camping, adults are prohibited from sleeping in pup-type tents with campers, unless it is a parent and his or her minor.

Control access to minors: Limit contact between minors and individuals not associated with the program while youth are under your care. Monitor the comings and goings of all youth and adults who enter and leave the facility. Be particularly alert to opportunities that are presented when activities occur in public spaces.

Conduct activities in spaces that are open and visible to multiple people. Ensure there are clear sight lines throughout the activity spaces. Secure areas not used for programmatic purposes (i.e. closets, storerooms) to prevent youth from being isolated.

Monitor your behavior and that of your peers. Counselor-to-counselor monitoring is critical to the health and protection of minors and to each other. An environment of heightened awareness and accountability is essential to preventing and addressing sexual abuse and molestation. To this end, all program staff and volunteers should be expected to monitor their own behavior, as well as the behavior of other staff/volunteers.

Camp staff/volunteers should model appropriate interpersonal behaviors. Be aware of a minor’s comfort level with activities, situations, and physical and emotional affection, and respond in an appropriate and consistent manner to minor behaviors. Use discretion in what personal or private experiences you share with a minor, and never discuss or ask minors questions about sexual experiences.

If a minor appears to be in immediate danger of serious harm, call 9-1-1 or the nearest law enforcement department to ensure the fastest possible response time to protect the minor.

State law requires, “any person having cause to believe that a minor’s physical or mental health or welfare has been adversely effected by abuse or neglect to immediately make a report” to law enforcement. Law enforcement is local police authorities and university police.

Tell the camp/program director – Once the incident is reported to law enforcement, notification must be given to the camp or program director (unless he/she is the source of the abuse or law enforcement directs you not to.

    Tutoring and mentoring a minor entail separate but equally important responsibilities
    No matter what your role is in working with a minor, it is important to remember that you have a strong influence over them. Make it a positive one
    Physical contact with a minor, no matter the intention, can make them uncomfortable and should be avoided. Some contact is strictly prohibited (i.e., frontal hugs, horseplay, sitting in laps, etc.)
    Limit contact with minors to the hours of sanctioned activities and be sure to have others around as often as possible
    Understand and practice the tenets of maintaining privacy for minors
    Use common sense – if you think circumstances would make a minor uncomfortable or feel unsafe, talk to someone
    If you believe a minor has been abused or neglected, or suspect any other dangerous conditions, make a report to law enforcement immediately
