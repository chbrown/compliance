The total number of persons within any type of facility is governed by fire code. The maximum occupancy for a venue is a key factor that allows everyone to evacuate a facility and reach an area of safety outside in the event of a fire or other emergency. An overcrowded facility reduces your chances to vacate an area of potential danger to an area of safety on the exterior of a building or facility.

    Always consider maximum capacity of spaces used for events located in:
        Your apartment
        Your fraternity-sorority reception area
        A classroom or lecture hall
        A nightclub or event venue
        Many permits may be required for public gatherings
    Also PACE (Public Assembly Code Enforcement) may shut down events that do not have the required city permits

        Lightning system at Clark Field

Online communities are a great way to keep in touch with members of your organization, friends and family. They are also great for meeting new people. However they can also pose a risk to your safety and privacy if the wrong person learns more about you than they should.

Protect yourself by:

    Using appropriate privacy settings that are available through on-line groups
    Knowing who you are friending
    Not being afraid to unfriend someone
    Not giving out passwords to ANYONE
    Keeping any threatening or harassing emails, text messages to show the police

Do you know what an emergency looks like? There are of course the obvious ones such as incidents involving injured persons, fights, weapons, stalking, harassment, and alarms sounding. But at other times you or a member of your organization may be unsure.

It could look like...

    A fight
    An alarm that is going off
    Someone who is continually sick; throwing up multiple times, falling down, losing consciousness
    Someone with a weapon
    Someone threatening another person or group either verbally or physically
