It is important as an organization to identify the types of events you will be conducting and their purpose - social, professional, intellectual, recreational, competitive, etc. Make sure you are asking whether the event is important to your organization's mission and goals. The following are examples of different types of events that your organization may conduct both on- and off-campus:

    Parties
    Social Mixers
    Philanthropy related Events
    Talent Show/Entertainment Events
    Sports related Tournaments
    Professional Social Gatherings
    Panels and workshops
    Conferences

When deciding to conduct an event or activity, consider these questions with your organization members before you begin planning:

    What is the purpose of the event? How will this event reflect the values of your organization?
    Who are you inviting?
    When is the event going to take place?
    Where is the event going to take place (on- or off-campus)?
    Who is organizing the event? Who is in charge of the event?
    Will alcohol be served at the event? If yes, who will be serving it?
    How much will the event cost? Do you have a budget in place? Will you be signing contracts?
    Do you have an emergency or crisis plan in place?

Theme parties are a popular social event for organizations. However, some theme parties have created controversy, in recent years, particularly culturally-based theme parties. Organizations choosing to have a culturally-based theme party should consider these questions before planning to host a culturally-based theme party:

    Why this theme?
    Is it about a living culture?
    Is it about a current subculture?
    Have you consulted either people from that community or with recognized "experts" (community leaders or faculty) about the theme?
    Are the people whose culture is being represented adequately empowered in society?
    Think and talk about what you are planning to do!

A risky and potentially offensive event some organizations choose to host to raise money is the "Date" or "Slave" Auction. While most organizations do this type of event with good intentions, the result can be damaging to the organization and participants. "Date" or "Slave" auctions involve "bidding" on a human being for their services or the ability to spend time with a certain person. This process devalues a human being to the level of merchandise and involves a comparison of the relative "value" of each person being auctioned.

In addition, it is important to consider safety concerns that arise as a result of "Date" auctions. When a person "wins" the ability to spend time with another person, there is no way of discerning their true motives. Given the prevalence of sexual assault in our culture, safety concerns exist if you allow a member of your organization to be compelled to spend time alone with someone that she/he may not know.

For ALL of these reasons, we encourage student organizations to engage in more imaginative and feasible alternatives to these activities.

It is important to know and understand what University policies and procedures apply when planning either an on-campus or off-campus event.

    Are you familiar with all the university rules and policies regarding events?
        Registered Student Organization Manual
        Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities
    Will and university rules or policies being violated by this event?
        Contact the Student Organization Center (SOC) at 512-471-3065
        Talk with other officers and/or your organization's advisor

If you continue to have questions or just want to check yourself, feel free to contact the Student Organization Center (SOC) at 512-471-3065 or stop by their office located on the fourth floor of the Student Services Building (SSB). They can connect you to numerous staff members in the Office of the Dean of Students trained to help student organizations with risk management and event planning.

In addition to expectations you or the University may have regarding events hosted by your organization, it is important to consider the potential for criminal or civil liability. There are both federal and state laws that can govern both how a student organization should be conducted as well as the conduct expected of participants. In choosing what events to schedule during the year, make sure you are considering the following questions:

    How will you ensure that members of the organization will not violate the law (e.g., underage drinking, driving while intoxicated, not wearing a seatbelt)?
    What are some potential legal issues that might emerge from your event and how can you prevent this?
    Will you or your organization be liable for any damages (property damage, breaching terms of a contract, accidents, etc.)?
    Are you aware of the types of liabilities (e.g. negligence, foreseeability, premise liability, contracts)?
    How can you reduce these liability issues?

Student organization events can be quite complex to manage (budgets, schedules, seating arrangements, training for volunteers, etc.). Select an officer, other organization member, or committee/team to take the lead (i.e., the event planners).

    Qualities of good event planners (or event planning teams) include:
        experience within the organization
        excellent organizational, communication and time management skills
        ability to handle stressful, fast-paced situations and
        passion and a strategic vision

Another important person that your organization should have is a Risk Management Officer. This officer will work with your advisor(s), the Office of the Dean of Students, and other organization leaders to identify risk and safety issues for your organization and develop appropriate responses.

    Member of your executive team - may be a new officer position that you create or it may be a responsibility added to an existing officer position
    Serves as the point of contact for your organization on risk management issues, but does NOT need to be a risk management "expert"
    Must be an active member of your executive team (authorized representative) with authority over risk management issues for your organization

The Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities (Appendix C of the General Information Catalog) outline the standards of conduct expected of all students and registered student organizations at the University of Texas at Austin. Whether your event is on- or off- campus, all Longhorns are expected to abide by these standards.

While not an exhaustive list, you and the members of your organization should be aware that the following behaviors violate these rules:

    Engaging in harassment or discrimination against another student or University employee
    Damaging, defacing, destroying, altering, or taking UT property without authorization of the University
    Impeding or interfering with an authorized University function
    Endangering the health or safety of another student or University employee
    Failing to identify oneself/providing false information to an institutional representative
    Unauthorized entry into university buildings or fountains
    Engaging in conduct that violates federal, state, or local laws

Not every event is a party or happy hour. Many UT student organizations are engaged in academic or professional endeavors such as conferences, corporate recruiting fairs, and professional association meetings. It is just as important during these professional events to address risk, set expectations, and represent the organization well. Tips for etiquette at professional events include:

    Show up on time, do not leave early!
    Do not use laptops or cell phones
    Ask appropriate questions
    Dress appropriately
    Let each person have a chance to speak
    Eat and drink in moderation
    Do not monopolize people's time - know what the purpose of the event is and be prepared

In a crisis, the steps you and other leaders of your organization take are essential in resolving the incident and ensuring everyone's safety.

    Always know who is in charge in the event of a crisis (e.g., President, Social Chairperson, Risk Management Officer)
    Get all of the officers together to discuss next steps and how to handle the crisis
    Assess the situation and decide on short-term and long-term steps to resolve the crisis
    Contact key people/offices as needed (e.g., EMS, Student Emergency Services, organization advisor, or national office)

If an emergency situation occurs at your event:

    Stop immediately and call 911 or local police
    Assess the situation and render aid as appropriate
    Fill out a police report
    Obtain the names and addresses of all witnesses
    Contact your advisor
    Avoid making statements as to who is at fault, nor should you make offers to pay for damages
    Contact one of the following areas in the Office of the Dean of Students for follow-up assistance:
        Student Emergency Services: 512-471-5017
        Student Activities: 512-471-3065

It is important as leaders of a student organization to set expectations for members about their behavior at events and activities. Any inappropriate behavior at your event is a reflection on you as a leader and on your organization.

If a member of your organization or a guest is behaving inappropriately at an event, it is important to address the situation right away. Find ways to address the inappropriate behavior in a private and discrete manner that causes the least amount of disruption of the event. When you are addressing the behavior, it is also important to do it in a manner where the situation will not escalate or get worse.

    Go STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE: Address the issue directly with the person/s who are acting inappropriately
    Remember that IT'S ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR AND NOT THE PERSON
    Involve your advisor and/or other sponsors (if present). An advisor and/or sponsor serve as a neutral party that can help mediate a situation and prevent it from escalating
    Explain clearly the behavior that is inappropriate and why
    If you feel like the situation is becoming dangerous or uncontrollable, seek assistance as needed (e.g. UT or Austin Police, etc)

Student organizations play an important part in building a safe, fun student community and event planning is an important part of this process. In review:

    Conducting an event requires a lot of planning, work and thought
    Your organization should have a designated Risk Management Officer
    Event planning can help to build and enhance your leadership skills
    Events are a reflection on not just you but your entire organization
    Your social events have the potential to benefit all members of your organization

When planning an event make sure to:

    Choose events that reflect the values and beliefs of your organization and members
    Invite people and groups you know
    Appoint or designate "event monitors" to handle emergencies and other details
    Appoint "designated drivers" if hosting an event where alcohol will be served
    Confront inappropriate behavior quickly and firmly
    Be sure to have a emergency/crisis management plan in place and review it with all of your members prior to the event
    Remember that the type of events you host are a reflection of your organization's values
