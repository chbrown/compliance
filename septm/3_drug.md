Prescription drug abuse is the use of prescription drugs - most commonly painkillers, sedatives and stimulants – in ways not intended by the prescribing doctor, including use by someone other than the patient prescribed the drug.

Some common examples are:

    OxyContin
    Vicodin
    Fentanyl
    Ambien
    Valium



    Xanax
    Ritalin

Prescription drugs are the most commonly abused drugs on college campuses. Individuals are abusing prescription drugs because they are widely available (usually from friends or relatives), free, and are not perceived to be as taboo or risky as illicit drugs.

Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs come in many different forms including liquid (in the case of cough syrup) or as a pill (in the case of aspirin). Individuals, particularly teenagers and college students, choose to abuse over-the-counter medications based on a perception that they can achieve certain goals such as lose weight, increase concentration, stay alert, or achieve a "high" or euphoric sensation.

Some common examples are:

    Dramamine
    Tylenol PM
    Sominex
    Cold Medicine/DXM



    Salvia
    Aspirin
    Diet pills
    Alcohol
